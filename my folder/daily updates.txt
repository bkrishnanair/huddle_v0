lib/db.ts` for fetching user events and sending/getting chat messages.

  - Modified `lib/db.ts` to save FCM tokens to user documents.
  - Integrated notification permission request into `app/layout.tsx` using a new component (`components/notification-permission-handler.tsx`).
  - Set up backend Cloud Functions directory and basic files manually (`functions/package.json`, `functions/index.js`) for scheduled notification logic (requires manual Firebase login and deployment).
- Enhanced events page (`components/events-page.tsx`):
  - Added client-side filtering and search.
  - Implemented a text input search bar, sport type filter, and date picker (using shadcn/ui components).

logout` function to `FirebaseContextType` and implemented it using `signOut` from Firebase.

  - Removed erroneous HTML tags (`<strong>`) from a comparison in `components/chat-page.tsx`.
  - Added null checks for the `auth` object in `lib/firebase-context.tsx` before using Firebase auth functions (`signOut`, `onAuthStateChanged`) to address TypeScript errors related to `Auth | null`.
- Continued refactoring and redesigning UI components:
  - Redesigned `components/chat-page.tsx` to match the "glassmorphism" aesthetic, improving layout and loading states.
  - Redesigned `app/profile/page.tsx` based on provided design reference, organizing content into distinct sections (header, stats, achievements, recent events, quick actions) using `glass-card


August 17th

- Completely redesigned the Profile Page (`app/profile/page.tsx`) to match the new "glassmorphism" design using `liquid-gradient` and `glass-card` components, while preserving all original functionality (stats, achievements, events, quick actions).
- Fixed a TypeScript error in `components/ui/calendar.tsx` by updating the `react-day-picker` component to use the correct `Chevron` component API for navigation icons (v8+).

- Resolved a radix-ui error in `components/create-event-modal.tsx` by removing an invalid `<SelectItem value="">` and using the `<SelectValue placeholder="...">` prop correctly.
- Implemented a permanent architectural fix for authentication:
  - Created `lib/firebase-admin.ts` to securely initialize the Firebase Admin SDK for server-side use.
  - Refactored `lib/auth.ts` to separate client-side (`getCurrentUser`) and server-side (`getServerCurrentUser`) authentication logic.
  - Updated the Events API route (`app/api/events/route.ts`) to use the correct server-side `getServerCurrentUser` function, resolving the 401 Unauthorized error.
  - Further refactored auth by creating a dedicated `lib/auth-server.ts` file for server-only logic, importing `cookies` and `firebase-admin`, and ensuring `lib/auth.ts` is purely client-side compatible, fixing the "next/headers" build error.


You are an assistant specialized in summarizing daily development activities. I will provide you with a text file containing my chat log with an AI code agent for today's work. Your task is to review this chat and create a clear, concise, and simple journal entry for today's development. Focus on what was implemented, built, or significant decisions made regarding the app's features or architecture. The entry should be easy to understand and serve as a quick reference for my progress.

Implemented several map optimizations:
  - Used client-side caching for event lists displayed on the map.
  - Optimized map queries by fetching events only within the current viewport.
  - Memoized map marker components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Configured the map to use a vector map with Map ID styling for better visual clarity and performance.
