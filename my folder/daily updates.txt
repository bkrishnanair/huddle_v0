You are an assistant specialized in summarizing daily development activities. I will provide you with a text file containing my chat log with an AI code agent for today's work. Your task is to review this chat and create a clear, concise, and simple journal entry for today's development(ignore the long codes just focus on what AI agent is saying, doing, changing,, fixing). Focus on what was implemented, built, or significant decisions made regarding the app's features or architecture. The entry should be easy to understand and serve as a quick reference for my progress.

  - Further refactored auth by creating a dedicated `lib/auth-server.ts` file for server-only logic, importing `cookies` and `firebase-admin`, and ensuring `lib/auth.ts` is purely client-side compatible, fixing the "next/headers" build error.


August 26th :

Implemented several map optimizations:
  - Used client-side caching for event lists displayed on the map.
  - Optimized map queries by fetching events only within the current viewport.
  - Memoized map marker components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Configured the map to use a vector map with Map ID styling for better visual clarity and performance.


geofire-common` for geohash calculations.

Aug 31st:
/api/users/[id]/events` was using client-side `getCurrentUser` instead of server-side `getServerCurrentUser` for authentication (violating architectural rule).
  - Corrected the API route to use `getServerCurrentUser` from `lib/auth-server.ts`.
  - Fixed a data structure mismatch in the `ProfilePage` component by mapping `organizedEvents` and `joinedEvents` from the API response to the expected `organized` and `joined` state properties.
  - Implemented robust error handling and ensured `userEvents` state is always initialized with default empty arrays to prevent crashes, even on API failure.

    - `/api/events/[id]/chat

bio` and `favoriteSports` fields.

Sep 2nd

  - Defined a new color palette, typography scale, and component styles in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`.
  - Refactored all major UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Chip`, etc.) to use the new design tokens.
- **Landing Page Redesign:**
  - Rewrote the hero section with new, benefit-led copy: "Stop the group-chat chaos. Find your game now."
  - Replaced static value cards with a dynamic, auto-rotating feature showcase.
- **In-App Screen Enhancements:**
  - **Discover Page:** Added a persistent search bar, filter chips, sorting controls, and a "Recommended for You" section.
  - **Map Page:** Added filter chips and a "Recenter" button.
  - **Profile Page:** Redesigned the layout with a more visually engaging header and clearer information hierarchy.
  - **Create Event Modal:** Introduced a disabled "Boost Event" feature to hint at future monetization.
- **New Feature - Public Profile Viewing:**
  - Created a new `PublicProfileModal` component to display a read-only view of a user's profile.
  - Implemented a new API endpoint to fetch public profile data.
  - Made the player list in the `EventDetailsModal` interactive, allowing users to tap on a player to view their profile.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Refactored the events API to handle viewport-based queries, significantly reducing the amount of data fetched.
  - Updated the Discover and Map pages to send map boundaries to the API.
  - Memoized the `EventCard` component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Build Fixes & Dependency Management:**

  - Fixed numerous build errors by restoring missing functions (`createUser`, `getEvents`, `saveFcmToken`, etc.) to the database library.
  - Corrected several TypeScript errors by creating a centralized `GameEvent` type and fixing incorrect import paths.
  - Enabled Turbopack for faster local development.


Sept 3-6th

/api/events/[id]/public-details` for fetching essential event info and `/api/events/[id]/guest-rsvp` for guest RSVPs) in `app/api/events/[id]`.
  - Modified Firestore event data model to accommodate guest RSVPs (`rsvps` array now stores objects with `userId` or `guestId`).
  - Created a new public-facing, login-free page (`app/events/[id]/page.tsx`) to display event details and handle guest RSVPs, prompting account creation only *after* RSVP.
  - Updated the `EventDetailsDrawer` component (`components/event-details-drawer.tsx`) to correctly display both registered user and guest names in the player list. This implementation leverages the existing public route structure (`app/events/[id]`) and maintains the security of authenticated routes.
- Implemented auto-login functionality in `components/auth-screen.tsx` to automatically log the user in after valid credentials are entered, removing the need for a manual button click. Improved loading states and error messages in the `AuthScreen`.
- Fixed a z-index issue in `components/location-search.tsx` within the Create Event modal that prevented selection from the Google Places Autocomplete dropdown by programmatically increasing the `.pac-container` z-index.
- Fixed a React error in `app/page.tsx` caused by a side effect (`router.push`) occurring during render by moving the redirect logic into a `useEffect
location-search.tsx` component to a simpler, working version.
  - Modifying the `create-event-modal.tsx

__session` cookie. This ensures that a user's client-side login state is correctly communicated to and verified by our backend.
Hardened Firebase Admin SDK Initialization: The initialization of the server-side Firebase Admin SDK was rewritten using an industry-standard singleton pattern. This fixed a critical bug where the SDK was failing silently, which was the root cause of the initial authentication failures.
2. Firestore & Backend Refactor: After fixing the authentication (401) errors, a new 500 Internal Server Error emerged.

Fixed Critical Database Issues: The investigation revealed two major problems. First, the server was trying to use client-side database credentials. Second, the database queries did not match the required Firestore indexes.
Architectural Separation: A clear separation was created between client-side and server-side database logic by creating a new `lib/db-server.ts` file. All API routes were updated to use this new server-only module.
Deployed Composite Indexes: The necessary composite indexes were defined in `firestore.indexes.json` and deployed. The server-side queries were then updated to match these indexes, resolving the 500 errors.
3. Location Search Component Rewrite: Throughout the process, a critical regression was introduced that completely broke the location search feature.

Migrated to Modern Google Maps API: The `LocationSearch


credentials: 'include'` to fetch requests in `components/create-event-modal.tsx` and `components/event-chat.tsx` to ensure the `__session` cookie is sent.
- Diagnosed Firestore 500 error on `/api/events` as a missing composite index issue.
- Instrumented `lib/db-server.ts` by adding logging and an intentional date filter to `getNearbyEvents` to trigger the index error and generate the index creation link in the Firebase console logs.
- Addressed TypeScript and import errors related to the new dynamic map markers:
  - Corrected `HuddleEvent` type import to `GameEvent` in `components/events/event-marker.tsx` and `components/map-view.tsx`.
  - Fixed icon imports in `components/events/event-marker.tsx` (e.g., `Basketball` to `Dribbble`, `SoccerBall` to `Football`).
  - Added the missing `onClick` prop to the `EventMarkerProps` interface.
  - Added explicit types for component props and function parameters in `components/map-view.tsx` to resolve 'implicitly has an 'any' type' errors.
- Resolved React hydration mismatch error on map view:
  - Used an `isMounted` state and `useEffect` in `components/map-view.tsx` to ensure map-related rendering occurs only on the client-side after mounting.
  - Added a loading state fallback for server-side rendering.
  - Corrected the way options are passed to the `<Map>` component, using individual props instead of a single `options


lib/firebase-admin.ts`) to fix server crashes (500 errors) and authentication failures (401 errors).
  - Centralized server-side authentication logic into a single `verifySession` function (`lib/auth-server.ts`) for improved security and consistency across API routes.
  - Applied server guard utility to the events route (`app/api/events/route.ts`) for centralized authentication enforcement.
- **Dependency Conflict Resolution:**
  - Downgraded React from version 19 to 18 (`package.json`) to resolve incompatibility with the `embla-carousel-react` dependency.
  - Removed incompatible pnpm overrides and reinstalled dependencies (`pnpm install`) to establish a stable project state.
- **Location Search Component Fixes:**
  - Rewrote the `LocationSearchInput` component (`components/location-search.tsx
