# Huddle: Internal Technical Documentation (V2)

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the "Huddle" application, designed for onboarding new developers and serving as a reference for the existing team.

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture

Huddle is a production-ready geospatial social platform for local pickup sports. The application is built on a modern, serverless architecture designed for scalability, security, and performance with full Next.js 15 compatibility.

**Core Architectural Pattern: Secure Route Groups**
The app's foundation is a **secure route group** structure implemented with the Next.js App Router. This is a critical concept for any developer working on the project.

-   **Public Routes (`/`)**: The root of the application is the public-facing landing and authentication page. It has its own simple layout and is the only part of the app accessible to unauthenticated users.
-   **Private Routes (`app/(app)/*`)**: All main application pages (`/map`, `/events`, `/chat`, `/profile`) are located inside a route group folder named `(app)`. This group is governed by a secure layout (`app/(app)/layout.tsx`) that acts as an **authentication gateway**. It automatically verifies the user's session and redirects any unauthenticated requests to the login page, ensuring the application is secure by default.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Framework**: Next.js (v15+) using the App Router with **Turbopack**
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Backend**: Firebase (Serverless)
    *   **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-In)
    *   **Database**: Cloud Firestore (NoSQL)
    *   **Serverless Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions
*   **Validation**: Zod
*   **Mapping**: Google Maps Platform
*   **UI**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui components
*   **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend) & Firebase (Backend)
*   **Package Manager**: PNPM

## 3. Database Schema (Cloud Firestore)

Data is organized into collections of documents. The schema uses denormalization for performance.

#### `users` collection
*   **Document ID**: User's Firebase `uid`.
*   **Description**: Stores public-facing and app-specific user information.
*   **Key Fields**: `uid`, `displayName`, `email`, `fcmTokens: Array<string>`, `bio: string`, `favoriteSports: Array<string>`, `badges: Array<string>`.
*   **Subcollections**:
    *   `connections/{userId}`: Stores connection requests and statuses. Each document represents a connection with another user.

#### `events` collection
*   **Document ID**: Auto-generated.
*   **Description**: Stores all data for a single event.
*   **Key Fields**:
    *   `title`, `sport`, `location`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `date`, `time`
    *   `maxPlayers`, `currentPlayers`
    *   `createdBy`: `uid` of the event organizer.
    *   `players: Array<string>`: An array of `uid`s for all RSVP'd users. (Denormalized for fast lookups)
    *   `checkedInPlayers: Array<string>`: An array of `uid`s for users the organizer has checked in. (Denormalized)
*   **Subcollections**:
    *   `chat/{messageId}`: Stores all messages for the event's real-time chat.

## 4. Authentication & Session Management (âœ… PRODUCTION READY)

The app uses a robust hybrid authentication model that is fully compatible with Next.js 15 and production-ready.

*   **Client-Side (`lib/auth.ts`)**: Contains functions for browser-based auth flows (login, signup, Google Sign-In) and a `getCurrentUser` function for synchronous UI checks.
*   **Server-Side (`lib/auth-server.ts`)**: Contains a `getServerCurrentUser` function that **must** be used in all API Routes. It securely verifies session cookies using the Firebase Admin SDK with proper Next.js 15 async cookies() support. This is the source of truth for user identity on the backend.
*   **Firebase Admin (`lib/firebase-admin.ts`)**: Modular Firebase Admin SDK initialization with proper error handling, health checks, and secure credential management.
*   **Session State (`lib/firebase-context.tsx`)**: A central React Context provider (`FirebaseProvider`) uses the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to manage the user's session state, making it available to all components via the `useAuth` hook.
*   **Security**: All protected routes include `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` and use secure HTTP-only session cookies for authentication.

## 5. API Endpoints (Next.js API Routes)

All API routes are located in the `app/api/` directory and are secured with Zod server-side validation.

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/api/events` | `GET` | Fetches nearby events with geospatial filtering and viewport optimization | âœ… Working |
| `/api/events` | `POST` | **Authenticated.** Creates single or recurring events with Zod validation | âœ… Working |
| `/api/events/[id]/details` | `GET` | **Authenticated.** Fetches detailed event info including player profiles | âœ… Working |
| `/api/events/[id]/rsvp` | `POST` | **Authenticated.** Join/leave events, awards badges, real-time updates | âœ… Working |
| `/api/events/[id]/checkin` | `POST` | **Authenticated & Organizer Only.** Real-time player check-ins | âœ… Working |
| `/api/events/[id]/chat` | `POST` | **Authenticated.** Real-time chat messaging with proper validation | âœ… Working |
| `/api/users/[id]/events`| `GET` | **Authenticated.** User's organized and joined events with pagination | âœ… Working |
| `/api/users/[id]/profile`| `GET` | **Authenticated.** Secure user profile access (self-only) | âœ… Working |
| `/api/users/profile`| `POST` | **Authenticated.** Profile updates with Zod validation | âœ… Working |
| `/api/connections/request`| `POST` | **Authenticated.** Send connection requests with validation | âœ… Working |
| `/api/connections/accept`| `POST` | **Authenticated.** Accept requests using Firestore transactions | âœ… Working |


## 6. Key Feature Implementations

*   **Server-Side Validation**: All critical API endpoints use `zod` schemas to validate incoming data, preventing invalid data from reaching the database.
*   **Global Error Notifications**: The app uses `sonner` to provide users with toast notifications for success and error states on all major actions.
*   **Automated Push Notifications (Cloud Function)**:
    *   A scheduled Cloud Function (`functions/send-reminders.js`) runs every 10 minutes.
    *   It queries for events starting in the near future, retrieves the `fcmTokens` for all RSVP'd users, and sends a reminder notification via Firebase Cloud Messaging.
*   **Gamification (Achievements)**:
    *   The `/api/events/[id]/rsvp` route contains logic to detect when a user joins their first event.
    *   When this occurs, the user's document is updated with a "first_game" badge, which is then displayed on their profile.

## 7. Local Development Setup

1.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file in the project root. It needs credentials for the Firebase Client SDK, Google Maps, and the Firebase Admin SDK (for server-side authentication). Refer to `README.md` for the full list of required variables.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: This project uses PNPM. You only need to install dependencies in the root directory.
    \`\`\`bash
    pnpm install
    \`\`\`
3.  **Run the App**:
    \`\`\`bash
    pnpm run dev
    \`\`\`
